ros-noetic-tesseract-common (0.3.0-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Only enable code coverage if compiler definition is set
  * Move serialize implementation to cpp based on boost documentation for shared libraries
  * Rename Any method cast() and cast_const() to as()
  * Remove NullAny structure
  * Cleanup equal operator
  * Fix satisfiesPositionLimits to use relative equal and calculation of redundant solutions to include all permutations
  * Split loading plugins into two classes ClassLoader and PluginLoader
  * Remove dependency on class_loader and leverage Boost DLL
  * Add PluginLoader class to tesseract_common
  * Fixup enforceJointLimits
    Up to now, it would incorrectly apply the upper limit to any position
    that's outside the range. For example, a position that's slightly under
    the lower limit would get assigned the upper limit. Fix this by using
    Eigen's min and max functions, resulting in a proper clamp.
  * Add satisfy and enforce position limits utility functions (#576 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract/issues/576>)
  * Add QueryIntAttributeRequired utility function
  * Add cmake format
  * Add support for defining collision margin data in SRDF (#573 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract/issues/573>)
  * Use boost targets, add cpack and license file (#572 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract/issues/572>)
  * Fix the way in which Eigen is included (#570 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract/issues/570>)
  * Add serializable any type erasure (#555 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract/issues/555>)
  * Add ToolCenterPoint unit tests
  * Start to adding boost serialization support
